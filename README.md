# Telco Customer Churn

### Introduction

The Telco data contains information about almost seven thousand three hundred users, their demographic characteristics, the services they use, the duration of using the operator’s services, the method of payment, and the amount of payment. The analysis of the data is to predict the churn of users (to identify people who will and will not renew their contract).

### Problem Statement

The Telco industry heavily relies on retaining existing customers. It’s vital for these organizations looking to grow their business without relying too heavily on the significantly higher cost of acquiring new customers. Marketing, sales, and customer retention departments need to work to make sure customers are satisfied, provide them with incentives, and present offers at the right time to reduce churn.

### Objective

1. To predict if a customer will churn
2. To identify the factors that contribute to customers churning
3. To build a classification model that would predict the customer churn
